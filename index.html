<h2 style="text-align: center;">PRIVACY POLICY MODEL FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Markit (“Application”) for mobile devices that was
    created by Jonathan Chang. Markit offers a fresh new fusion of social media and location sharing where users follow people and build a profile of
    “marks” on a map. Markit will connect people of shared experiences and interests and forever change the way people
    create genuine human connection. To use, create "marks" at all your favorite places, add them multiple times if you want to keep track of all your
    visits, and follow others to populate your feed and map with marks from everywhere around the world.
